#### Layer 1 Physical

* Responsible for transmition and recieving of signals that represent bits of data from one node to another.
* A physical cable i.e. RJ45 or Fibre optic cable
* Examples: Cabled & Wireless

#### Physical topology
* An area of a larger network is called a segment
* A network is typically divided into segments to deal with physical restrictions, performance & security.
* At this layer a segment is where nodes share access to same media

#### Physical interface
* Cable specs
* Network medium
* Medium connector and pin-out details
* Radio transceiver specs
* Modulation schemes & timing / synchronization

#### Devices that operate at the Physical Layer
* Transceiver - sends and receives signals over the network
* Repeater - Amplifies an electronic signal to extend maximum distance to media
* Hub
* Media converter - converts signal from one type to another
* Modem - performs signal modulation and demodulation
